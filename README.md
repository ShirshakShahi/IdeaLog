# IdeaLog

_This is a simple **ReactJS Application** for taking notes._

> I am building this while preparing for my 4th-semester board exams, which are scheduled for August 20. As a result, it may take some time to complete, and I will update this README.md file as frequently as possible during this period. My aim is to document as many aspects of the project as I can and present a clean and organized README.md.

### Technologies Used:

*  **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the Build Tool**
*  **User Authentication using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**
*  **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for State Management**
*  **[React Router DOM v6](https://reactrouter.com/) for Routing**
*  **[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as the UI Library**

Your support, feedback, and understanding during this exam period are greatly appreciated. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I'm excited to share my progress and improvements with you all. Let's build something amazing together!

**Note:** Please pardon any errors or delays in updating the README.md during my exam preparations. I will do my best to maintain the quality and keep you informed. Your patience is valued!

Let's make this project a success! üöÄ


# Day 1 Progress

Today, I made significant progress with the project. Here's what I accomplished on Day 1:

1. **Installed Ant Design and Explored Components:**
   I started by installing Ant Design, a powerful UI library that will enhance the aesthetics and functionality of the application. I took the time to explore various components available in Ant Design and familiarized myself with the customization options.

2. **Planned Sign Up and Login Pages:**
   With Ant Design in place, I am now ready to move on to the next phase. My plan for the upcoming days is to work on the sign-up and login pages of the application using Firebase for user authentication. I will ensure that the authentication process is secure and user-friendly.

3. **Frequent GitHub Updates:**
   Throughout the development process, I will be actively updating the project on GitHub to keep everyone informed about the progress. I aim to maintain transparency and openness, even during the exam preparation period.

Stay tuned for more updates! üìùüöÄ
