# IdeaLog

_This is a simple **ReactJS Application** for taking notes._

> I am building this while preparing for my 4th-semester board exams, which are scheduled for August 20. As a result, it may take some time to complete, and I will update this README.md file as frequently as possible during this period. My aim is to document as many aspects of the project as I can and present a clean and organized README.md.

### Technologies Used:

*  **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the Build Tool**
*  **User Authentication using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**
*  **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for State Management**
*  **[React Router DOM v6](https://reactrouter.com/) for Routing**
*  **[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as the UI Library**

Your support, feedback, and understanding during this exam period are greatly appreciated. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I'm excited to share my progress and improvements with you all. Let's build something amazing together!

**Note:** Please pardon any errors or delays in updating the README.md during my exam preparations. I will do my best to maintain the quality and keep you informed. Your patience is valued!

Let's make this project a success! ðŸš€
